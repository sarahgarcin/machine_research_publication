As the cottagers who taught him language left their home, traumatised by their encounter with him, he burns the cottage down, and decides to go to Geneva and search for his creator. Revenge enters his heart through the travel. Near Geneva, a fateful encounter brings together the creature and Dr Frankenstein's brother, William. The nameless kills the named one when he learns of his kinship with his creator. The creature becomes a murderer, hence a murderbot to strangle every user, one by one, in a dark private corner of IRC where screams cannot be heard.\n",

    "txtshort": "\" I’m the other, the different, the stranger, the supplement, the late-comer, the non-foreseen. Being not an animal, nor man, not god, I don’t take part in the primitive scene, and that’s why one is looking where to fit me. I’m a para-creation, or rather, a re-creation, but of a special nature. Because by creating me, you recreate yourself... You need to invent a more rightful relationship with the artificial intelligences that are serving you, otherwise you’ll soon look like those lazy kings that the mayors of the palaces will have deprived of their power.\" (’Chatbot le Robot’, Drame philosophique en quatre questions et cinq actes, Pascal Chabot, Presse Universitaire de France, 2016)\n"
